As the afternoon sun dipped lower, Anna stood by the pond, 
watching a kayak glide silently across the water. The 
reflection of the civic building rippled in the breeze, 
its modern design contrasting with the ancient deified statues 
that lined the entrance. A soft hum from a nearby racecar 
broke the tranquility, and above her, drones with sleek rotator 
blades hovered in place. The quiet level of peace in that 
moment seemed unbreakable, offering a rare chance to simply 
breathe and appreciate the scene.
