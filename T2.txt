The racecar sped down the quiet level street, its rotor 
humming softly. As it passed a civic center, a group of 
people walked by, admiring the deified statue at the 
entrance. Rotator blades on nearby drones whirred in 
the background, and a lone kayak rested at the edge of 
the pond. Moments later, Anna, one of the tourists, 
smiled at the simple joy of a peaceful day.
